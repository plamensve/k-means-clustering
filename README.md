# k-means-clustering
A minimal and clear implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm. The project demonstrates how to group data points into K clusters based on similarity, using iterative centroid updates until convergence. Includes data preprocessing, visualization of clusters, and configurable parameters such as number of clusters and initialization method.
